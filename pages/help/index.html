          <h1>The Service</h1>
          <p>
            Flipboard helps to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life
            they love.<br />To provide the Service, we need to be able to
            identify you and your interests, and we use your personal data to do
            this.<br />
            As part of the Service, we try to ensure that even promoted content
            is relevant and interesting to you. You can identify promoted
            content because it will be clearly labelled.
